Scripts
##
Look inside package.json under "scripts" tag to see what scripts can be run (run in console "> npm run script-name")
- npm run start (starts up local server to view app in browser as development happens)
- npm run build (builds deployable files of application)
- npm run test (runs test suite from App.test)

##
General Notes
##
- create-react-app no longer supported globally (uninstall then reinstall so npx can use latest version)
